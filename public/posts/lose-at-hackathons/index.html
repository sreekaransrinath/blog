I promise this isnâ€™t clickbait.\nIf you donâ€™t know what a hackathon is or have never attended one, head here.\nTo start with - What even IS a hackathon? Simply put, hackathons are 24, 36, or 48 hour-long (sometimes longer, but very rarely) technology festivals. Theyâ€™re somewhere you can meet like-minded people, learn new things, and create cool technology. They can sound pretty intimidating - but you donâ€™t have to be some genius or a coding pro to take part.\nDespite the name, hackathons are not places where people gather to hack in the conventional sense of the word. Make-a-thons would be a more appropriate name, and these are basically competitions where participants (â€˜hackersâ€™) hack together a minimum viable solution to a problem they see or face.\nNow, I donâ€™t mean to say you should go into a hackathon wanting to lose, just that thereâ€™s a lot more to hackathons than just winning.\nThereâ€™s free food and swag.\nWait, what? That wasnâ€™t supposed to be in the script! Editor, cut that out, please :)\nJokes apart, though, over the course of my journey participating, mentoring, judging, and organizing hackathons, Iâ€™ve come to see that aiming for the prize is fun and all, but itâ€™s just the tip of the iceberg.\nYou see, hackathons, by their very nature, attract very like-minded people, and serve as a breeding ground for innovation. And guess who wants a slice of that pie?\nEmployers.\nHackathons can double up as recruitment drives (sometimes more overtly than others). Still, the fact remains that at every hackathon thatâ€™s being sponsored by companies that deal with tech, there are going to be representatives of said companies scouting for top talent.\nAll you need to do to take advantage of these is head over to voice chats/sponsor booths and build rapport with the recruiter/engineer.\nDepending on what the hackathon youâ€™re attending looks like, sometimes it might just be a better idea to forgo some features in your hack to make sure you cover all of these opportunities!\nAnd along with this, there are tons more to do at every hackathon you attend, which you should (arguably) prioritize over just winning.\nSo if you shouldnâ€™t focus on winning, what should you be doing? Demo. This is one of the best things you could do at a hackathon. Personally, demoing in live streams at hackathons turned out to be the trigger that eventually led me to create content and speaking live in front of hundreds of people.\nNot only does demoing help you figure out how to sell something youâ€™ve worked on (which is a super underrated but important skill for a developer), it gives you the confidence to put yourself out there more often (this can work wonders in your personal life as well!). Also, it helps you polish your public speaking skills.\nFocus on building something with a language/framework youâ€™ve never used before. This is probably the most stressful yet fun part of every hackathon - picking up something youâ€™ve never used (or even heard of!) before, and in the short span of a day or two, turning it into something that resembles an actual product ;).\nWho knows? You might find that one niche that you really love and youâ€™re good at as well!\nLearn to collaborate with teammates. The whole point of having teammates at a hackathon is to divide work amongst them such that people get to work on stuff theyâ€™re good at, much like developer and open-source teams.\nThink of them as training sessions to learn to collaborate better with other people, and youâ€™ll work wonders! ;)\nMake some new friends. Last (but certainly not least), whatâ€™s a competition without people? If youâ€™re at an in-person event, take trips between tables to chill with other hackers/mentors (even organizers, assuming theyâ€™re not busy putting out fires 24/7 :P).\nIf youâ€™re at an online event, itâ€™s as simple as participating in some hangouts or mini-events!\nTo conclude, winning cool prizes and swag can be motivating and fun, so I recommend analyzing the prize categories, prizes, and other opportunities at a hackathon before creating your strategy. A healthy balance is always a good idea; at the end of the day, make sure youâ€™ve had fun and maybe (just maybe ;)) learned something!\nIf this has got you pumped to participate in a hackathon, hereâ€™s some great places to find some - MLH HackerEarth Devpost Devfolio\nif you gained something from this piece, feel free to connect with me on Twitter @skxrxn, Instagram @skxrxn, GitHub, or LinkedIn :)\n","wordCount":"772","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2021-07-18T00:00:00+05:30","dateModified":"2021-07-18T00:00:00+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sreekaran"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/lose-at-hackathons/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Sreekaran's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Sreekaran's Blog (Alt + H)">Sreekaran's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/sreekaransrinath/blog title=repo><span>repo</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;Â»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why You Should Lose at Hackathons</h1><div class=post-description>Yes, I said what I said ðŸ˜¤</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-07-18 00:00:00 +0530 +0530'>July 18, 2021</span>&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;Sreekaran&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/sreekaransrinath/blog/tree/main/content/posts/lose-at-hackathons.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#to-start-with---what-even-is-a-hackathon aria-label="To start with - What even IS a hackathon?">To start with - What even IS a hackathon?</a></li><li><a href=#so-if-you-shouldnt-focus-on-winning-what-should-you-be-doing aria-label="So if you shouldn&rsquo;t focus on winning, what should you be doing?">So if you shouldn&rsquo;t focus on winning, what should you be doing?</a><ul><li><a href=#demo aria-label=Demo.>Demo.</a></li><li><a href=#focus-on-building-something-with-a-languageframework-youve-never-used-before aria-label="Focus on building something with a language/framework youâ€™ve never used before.">Focus on building something with a language/framework youâ€™ve never used before.</a></li><li><a href=#learn-to-collaborate-with-teammates aria-label="Learn to collaborate with teammates.">Learn to collaborate with teammates.</a></li><li><a href=#make-some-new-friends aria-label="Make some new friends.">Make some new friends.</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Thatâ€™s a forking controversial title if youâ€™ve ever seen one, but hear me out.
